This is a small collection of halloween costumes that is used for testing the data processing script.

There are two types of files:
* **Valid**: this is an image that *should* be included in the cleaned dataset (though it might need additional processing such as background removal). The key feature of this type of file is that it contains a single person.
* **Invalid**: this an image that *should not* be included in the cleaned dataset (usually because it contains multiple people).
